# Owl Book Code Repository

## Running Code 

We have provided code snippets in this repository. To save you from the effort of installing all the required components to run the code, we have provided a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/owlbarn/springer-book-code/blob/main/Dockerfile) for you to get start with.
All you need to do is to build a docker image, run it, and all the code snippets are already included in the directory `/home/opam/book-code/`.
You can then fire up the `utop` REPL to play with these code in whatever way you want.
